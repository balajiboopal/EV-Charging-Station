# EV-Charging-Station
This project leverages LSTMs for time-series forecasting, GANs for data augmentation, and Reinforcement Learning for dynamic pricing to predict energy consumption at EV charging stations. By analyzing historical charging patterns, it optimizes grid usage, battery storage efficiency, and pricing strategies.
